Do you ever meet someone through the pages of a book they wrote or a documentary they presented and feel your perspective of the world shifting a little? Or find yourself being hit by an intense sense of being known because they "give expression to the truth that has been dumbly struggling in you for utterance"*? Ever get a little sad because they died 100 years ago and there's no chance you will ever be friends irl? These are some people that make me feel like that.
