When I was younger I turned my nose up at the thought of reading (much less _writing_) short stories for enjoyment. Short stories, I believed, were the province of English teachers and pretentious magazines. Created for no other end than to be clever and to be overanalysed by clever people.Â 

This conviction was only intensified by the fact that I wasâ€”and very much still amâ€”a reader who prefers to become fully immersed in something. I love depth and detail and rich worlds and epic scale and descriptions that are not afraid to be a little flowery. I want to be able to enter into the world I'm reading about for a good chunk of real-world time. And all of these things, I was convinced, could not be satisfactorily delivered upon in the short story format. Especially with regards to fantasy! How can one possibly convey depth and detail and epic scale and build a whole new world _well_ in the span of a few thousand words when some authors even struggle to give such things their due in a few _hundred_ thousand words?

No, short stories were not for me, I reasoned. Reading them, or writing them

And yet, I just kept on stumbling upon them in my personal journey of developing my writing craft. Eventually, after years of gentle coaxing by the likes of Isaac Asiimov, Ray Bradbury, H.P. Lovecraft and a couple of other quirky individuals who have had more success as speculative fiction writers than I can ever hope for, I was swayed to explore this dark side in more depth.

Now, after a year and a bit of intentionally seeking out and consuming speculative fiction short stories, I think I might finally be developing a taste and an understanding for them.

### The Art of the Short Story  

This is where the hesitant plunge into this realm all started. I am sure most aspiring writers have at some point read or heard it said that a short story is, in a lot of ways, a harder thing to write than a novel. And yetâ€”I always thought rather ironicallyâ€”also been strongly advised to write some short stories of their own because nothing will teach you better and quicker than churning out a load of short stories will. You tell me the thing is hard and then you tell me I should go do the thing even though I'm so green and inexperienced? For years I did not give this advice the credence or the consideration it deserved.  

After all, on the surface, the words 'short' and 'story' put together seem so clear and concise in their meaning. What more can there be to it beyond what those two words already reveal? It is a story, and it is short. Beyond this, the only other thing that set it apart from all other fiction was that, in my experience, short stories were all the kind of dry but insanely clever thing that English teachers make students read and then over-analyse so that by the end of their encounter with it the story is no longer clever, it is only insufferable.  

Despite this shallow understanding of what a short story is, I tried a few times in university to write some. But it was _difficult_. Just like everyone said it would be. Especially fantasy. How in high heaven do you condense character, narrative and an entire world into something that doesn't exceed 7 000 words while giving it a satisfying, punchy ending and still enjoy the creative process all the while? I couldn't fathom it.

I only really knew novels intimately, and a novel has pages and pages to get you invested in its plot and its world and its characters, to make you care and root for its characters and their goals and world. Time and depth are its tools. You can condense a whole story, sure. But a novel story condensed into a few thousand words does not make for a short story. It makes for a summary, and most summaries are not very fun to read, or write. So, seemingly at a dead-end when it came to the matter of craft, I decided the smart thing to do was pursue a bit more theoretical knowledge about the art of writing a short story before trying my hand at writing a short story again.Â 

One of the first pieces of advice that I remember dwelling on for a few days was this:  

> "_The best of my short stories are_ _the last chapters of novels I didn't write._" (Neil Gaiman, possibly paraphrased, I have only heard it quoted a few times via YouTubers who took his Masterclass and just grabbed this from a cursory Google search)

(Disclaimer: I have not yet read a Neil Gaiman short story, though I do count _Stardust_ among my favourite works of fiction). Upon first hearing this attributed to one of the modern masters of fantasy it sounded like solid and applicable advice. But when I gave it a bit more thought, and tried to actually apply it, I found it a little too vague. A last chapter is often the wrap-up for a much longer story. The final pay-off after chapters and chapters of conflict and tension and set-up and revelations. Last chapters can also vary a lot across stories and genres. I do not think, for example, that the last chapter of _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ would make for a good short story (granted it's been 16 years since I read it). Of course, that's probably not exactly what Gaiman meant. While there's certainly some merit in this concept, and there are definitely a few short stories I have read that I think fit this criteria, I didn't find it particularly helpful in application. I think it is a helpful thing to keep in mind when choosing and refining ideas to explore in a short story, but last chapters are complex beasts that are determined by the nature of the rest of story they are closing off.

Shortly after this, I came across something that gave me a few more specifics to work from. I believe it was Shaelin from [ShaelinWrites](https://www.youtube.com/@ShaelinWrites/featured), who said a short story is (very wild and loose paraphrasing):

> "... _about a specific moment, culminating in a character having a realisation or making a choice_."

This was one of the tips that helped shift my perspective on how to think of short stories and develop ideas for them. It's not about condensing a whole story, it's about finding a pivotal moment within a character's life or a larger story, and zooming in on that. But I also found it a bit limiting for how my own mind works. I tried to take it far too literally and then get stuck trying to build a story around the precise second when Character A's brain goes 'Ahah! I am a changed person, I have a new perspective now' or something along those lines, and this inevitably gets me nowhere as I start fixating far too early on in my writing process about how this moment _should_ play out instead of letting the story take me somewhere and show me what that moment is of its own accord.  

Then, I found this line and it was the real lightbulb moment for me:

> "_So what is a pro-level story? It's a_ joke." ([Chasing the First Sale: Part 2](http://stevenrstewart.blogspot.com/2012/06/chasing-first-sale-part-2-what-pro.html) by Steven R. Stewart)

Stewart goes on to explain what he means in the paragraphs that follow, but for me that line alone made realisation dawn. In hindsight, it's one of those things that seems so utterly obvious now that I know it. But this really was just the phrasing I needed for what I had already been noticing in all of the stories that did resonate with me to click together. The setup always came back in some meaningful way at the end. The resolution or the culmination was usually introduced somewhere in the earliest paragraphs--just like with a joke. Yes, I know about Chekhov's gun. That's a fundamental writing tip if there ever was one. But just because something that was introduced earlier shows up again in a meaningful way doesn't mean it's going to be satisfying, or that it becomes the golden thread that holds the story together. The key for a short story is that it's not just got to be Chekhov's gun, it's got to be Chekhov's punchline. You have your setup, and then you have your punchline, and the punchline lives or dies based on how well the setup and the delivery are handled.Â 

I considered this new kernel of knowledge in relation to some of the short stories I had most enjoyed in my reading adventures up to that point and realised, _Yes_. Every single one of them utilised this concept in some capacity. Something was introduced early on, often quite subtly. That same something would come back towards the end, at the climatic moment, sometimes bringing a new perspective or changing its role or revealing itself to have been the solution all along. This, I felt, was the key I was missing in how I tried to compose a short story. Around the same time as this revelation, I also had a second realisation, specifically with regards to the speculative short story and its craft. Especially those taking place in fantastical worlds.Â 

A short story is not likely to reach the same depth and epic scale of a novel, but why should it have to? Is a short story really lesser than a longer work because of the confines of its length? No, I realised, because it can still _evoke_ that same sense. In many ways, the best speculative short stories I have found are like appetisers for greater works. They make me believe there is a greater world and they make me want to know more about it. They may not give me that _more_, but the yearning and the sense of curiosity that they deliver is its own delight. They are designed to be small and delectable and eaten in one or two bites, and to leave the reader perhaps a little hungry for more and bigger portions.

These are two kernels of knowledge about the art and craft of the short story which I have gleaned from all my reading thus far. They probably sound exceedingly obvious to someone reading this, but I can be quite a slow learner who tends to work on intuition and lets understanding come later (big source of frustration, would not recommend. Made mathematics and science unbearable subjects in high school). So these were both pretty big eureka moments for me, and they have made the task of figuring out how to turn an idea into a short story feel much more attainable, as well as giving me a bit of a framework for analysing the short stories I read.Â 

So, it turns out there's more to short stories than I previously believed. They have their own unique quirks and characteristics that set them apart from the novel in more than just word count and academic value. This appreciation, alas, has only begun to come recently to me. I think this is partly because, as it seems for many people, short stories can really be kind of hit-and-miss, and that is it's own mystery which I am still trying to make sense of.

### The Appreciation  

How, and why, would someone ever want to be a gardener if they don't enjoy gardens? Why are you gardening if not for the joy of the garden? Is it for the accolades? The money? You're unlikely to get either of those as a run-of-the-mill gardener. Unless you happen to be good enough to manage the gardens of Versailles or something. Should it not be the same way with writing? I am a firm believer that you can'tâ€”or shouldn'tâ€”be a writer if you aren't a reader. But I digress and I won't go into more detail on that here, only to say that since I started reading short stories I find writing them much more approachable and enjoyable.

On top of my teenage biases and assumptions about short stories, I also thought I knew quite a lot of what there was to know about high fantasy because I had read _The Lord of the Rings_ and its adjacent works, _Harry Potter_, _Narnia_, a handful of the _Discworld_ novels, the first three books of the _Inheritance Cycle_, half of _Magician_, a few volumes of the _Wheel of Time_, and had thoroughly perused David Pringle's _The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy_ from cover to cover. I knew all about swords and sorcery and dragons and quests and quasi-medieval cultures, and I knew that the genre was over-saturated with them and their assorted spin-offs.  

But where, I wondered in my naivety, were all the cool experimental new ideas? Sure, some of them were in novels here and there, few and far between. But most of them, it turns out, were hiding in short stories the whole time.Â 

In a year and a bit of concentrated short story consumption I have encountered more unique concepts and worlds than I would manage to find the time to experience in novels. And this, in itself, is one of the biggest arguments that won me over to the short story. It is much easier and quicker to experiment and tinker in a short story than to waste months, years possibly, on a novel only to realise the experimental thing doesn't work at all. This, I think, is true for both writers and readers. Nothing is more dismaying than to invest lots of time and care in something, and only come out with disappointment in the end.Â 

This is truly one of the beauties of the short story format. Writers can experiment on a smaller, quicker scale, and readers can consume a huge array of ideas and writing styles in far less time than a novel takes. Four stories from a fantasy shorts magazine like _Beneath Ceaseless Skies_ can present four entirely unique writing styles and worlds and narratives, and can be read two in an evening if desired.  

I'm not saying this efficiency makes short stories a superior means of consuming fiction, not at all. I'd still pick a novel over a short story any day, for the reasons previously mentioned, but there is really something freeing about how small the commitment is when you approach a short story. If it brings you delight it was half an hour well spent. If it doesn't, it's not that big of a deal because you only lost half an hour of your time. And was it even really lost? You might have been able to identify what you didn't like about it, and that's still some kind of gain.  

On that, there are a lot of short stories that just don't land for me. Even with all the reading I've been doing, I'd say that about two fifthsâ€”even from collections and magazines I really enjoyâ€”just make me go "huh?". I reach the end, and the world was not enticing, sometimes not even pleasant or interesting to me, and I didn't get the 'joke'. Perhaps the punchline didn't arrive, or I just didn't understand it well enough when it did come. Then, there's about two fifths that I feel neutral about. I can see what the author was doing, there are some moments I liked, some things I can glean from them, but overall theyâ€”to use that phrasing editors love to include in their rejection lettersâ€”_weren't quite right_ for me. But then, there's that final one fifth, and that batch of short stories makes the other four fifths well worth it. These are the stories where the world is enticing and the punchline lands, and they are always an absolute delight to find. They usually linger with me for a few days, and leave me feeling a little elated after I finish them.Â   

#### Some stories from that one-fifth-of-delight  

_[Beneath Ceaseless Skies](https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/)_ and [_Bourbon Penn_](https://www.bourbonpenn.com/) have quickly become two of my favourites short story magazines just for the creativity and variety they offer, and their tendency to exhibit a more literary style. And they're both free to read online, which is amazing!  

Here are some favourites I have collected in my readings so far:  

[_A Happy Family_ by Nathanial Towers](https://www.bourbonpenn.com/issue/1/a-happy-family-by-nathaniel-tower) (_Bourbon Penn_ Issue #1): Entertained me way too much.  

[_Redbark and Ambergris_ by Kate Alice Marshall](https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/red-bark-and-ambergris/) (_Beneath Ceaseless Skies_ Issue #232): Beautiful description and world-building and story.  

[_How to Raise a Kraken in Your Bathtub_ by P. DjÃ¨lÃ­ Clark](https://www.uncannymagazine.com/article/how-to-raise-a-kraken-in-your-bathtub/) (_Uncanny_ Issue #50): Delightful and really well executed.

_The Triumph_ by Robin Hobb (in _[Warriors](https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?304811)_, edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois): A wonderful historical tale of friendship with a fantasy twist.

[_Whatever Knight Comes_ by Ryan Row](https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/whatever-knight-comes/) (_Beneath Ceaseless Skies Issue_ #226): Loved the concept and the way it was written. I understand what the author was trying to do with the ending, but it didn't quite land for me. Still enjoyed the whole journey leading up to it, though.

[_The Wind Shall Blow_ by Gregory Norman Bossert](https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/the-wind-shall-blow/) (_Beneath Ceaseless Skies Issue_ #209): I just found the atmosphere and tone of this whole story to be so beautiful in a melancholic way. The Scottish border war seeming setting was also fresh and unusual for me.  

But my **_absolute_** favourite short story so far is without a doubt [_Half-Spent Was the Night_ by Gretchen Tessmer](https://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/half-spent-was-the-night/) (_Beneath Ceaseless Skies_ Issue #371): I love everything about this story! I love it so much I think I might make a little analysis about it one day just so I can spend a few hundred words gushing about it. Reading this over a few times also really emphasised the two points I have picked up about short stories in all my reading so far.

I've gathered a nice little stack of favourites from that one fifth, but I'm not planning to stop reading short stories anytime soon. I'm part way through an issue of _Uncanny_ and have still got an untouched issue of [_Clarkesworld_](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#) and _[Apex Magazine](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#)_ on my e-reader, and plan to follow those with _[Andromeda Spaceways](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#)_ and _[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#)_ very soon.

I've also got a stack of speculative fiction short story collections I still need to get to and hope to report back on sometime soon (many of them are pictured in the image at the top of this post):

_At the Edge of the World_ by Lord Dunsany  

_The Mammoth Book of Fantasy_, edited by Mike Ashley

_Nine Tomorrows_ by Isaac Asiimov

_The Martian Way_ by Isaac Asiimov  

_Quicker Than the Eye_ by Ray Bradbury

_Year's Best Fantasy Volume 5_, edited by David G. Hartwell and Kathryn CramerÂ 

This all on top of my regular non-fiction and novel reading. Will I ever get through them all? Certainly not in the course of the next few months, but I live in hope.

I'm still trying to identify exactly why some stories work for me and others don't. I have a few ideas, but so far a lot of it seems to come down to personal preference and imagery or themes that resonate with me.This is perhaps one of the weaknesses of the short story. Because it has to be so focused and is so short, it cannot capture as many aspects of life and the human experience as a novel can. I know most people don't enjoy _every_ aspect of a novel in equal measure, no matter how much they like it or the author behind it. Some like the magic system and the world-building most of all, others enjoy the characters more, some are propelled through books by the romance subplots. The short story can't rely on these things. It has only time and focus for one or two things, and if those things don't fulfill a reader's subjective preferences from the start, they certainly aren't likely to suddenly deliver on them at the end.Â   

Overall, though, I am very glad to have had my eyes opened to the world of speculative short fiction. It took some time, and though many stories still don't land for me half of the joy is looking for the next one that does. And those that do land have often landed so well that I find myself revisiting them and thinking about them long after they have ended.Â  These little realisations I have had so far are but the tip of a complex and bewildering iceberg that is full of many unique and fascinating pieces and techniques and also years and years of careful craft-honing.  

I do think that short stories can be a bit of an acquired taste, but, unlike wine, I seem to be developing a palate for them the more I consume them.  

![[images/Section break 1.png]]

I am also quite proud to say that I have gathered up 7 short story rejections of my own thus far for a 2 400 word piece I wrote in August 2022.Â 

By the end of this year I hope for it to be an even higher number, and to have a second short story in circulation to collect even more rejections alongside it. For now I am only two scenes in with that second short story, but am confident that I'm building on some of the lessons learnt from that first story and that it will be a functional piece very soon ðŸ¤ž

I hope that one day I can write a short story that delights and lingers with someone the way some of them have delighted and lingered with me.
