> "If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"

I came across this quote quite long ago, when I was in my early teens and obsessed with gathering quotes that sounded cool and poetic and profound, without really taking much concern for their source and full context.  I did not realise at the time that the source of this particular quote happened to be lying on a shelf in a room a few metres away.  Three thick, dusty, paperbacks from the 1970s that my dad had acquired at some point in his university days, which had since found their way to my brother's bedroom: *The Gulag Archipelago*.

At some point in my life I was informed that Russian authors had a reputation for being dense and overly-detailed. With this knowledge in the back of my mind and armed with all the unearned pride and cocky confidence of a teenager, at 16 I started reading *War and Peace* on my ereader. I was on holiday, sitting in a wooden loft in the middle of a game reserve. A very contrary location to the book's opening scene--a glamorous soiree attended by aristocrats in ball-gowns and black tie. I think? I don't really remember much, except for some excruciatingly detailed descriptions of dresses. I did not get very far past that description of the dress. My ereader broke at some point a few months later, and with that my first attempt at reading *War and Peace* came to a definitive end.  Had I learnt my lesson about Russian authors? No. 

A few years later, probably around the time we began to *properly* learn about Communism in Grade 11 history, while borrowing something from my brother's collection, I came to find three serious-looking thick, dusty volumes with browning pages and a grave looking grayscale man on two of their covers. I'd seen them on the shelf many times. My brother had even been reading one of them in a long car-ride sometime back. I'd always seen them, but never given any attention to what they were. A Russian writer talking about what I understood at the time to be Communist Russia's equivalent to the Nazi Concentration Camps of the Holocaust. 


- I started the Gulag Archipelago, and fell off the bus early on, though a little further in than I'd managed with War and Peace
I thought that it would be dark and gloomy. 

I reintroduced myself to Solzhenitsyn some time later with "*One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*"--a much slimmer volume than the megalith of intellectual and emotional investment that the Gulag Archipelago posed.
