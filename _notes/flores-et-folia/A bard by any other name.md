If you are remotely familiar with _Dungeons & Dragons_ or the conventions of modern fantasy you know about bards. The image that word conjures in your mind is likely one of a traveling performer with an instrument (usually a lute or mandolin) strapped to their back, the skill to whip up a song or a turn-of-phrase on the fly, and a catalogue of ballads and stories preserved to memory to boost both the morale and the reputation of their traveling companions. In between gleefully embarking (or being dragged) on adventures they earn their keep by performing these songs and stories at inns or taverns. They are usually charismatic individuals with a penchant for being brightly dressed, quirky, intelligent, emotional, overdramatic, and probably also a little mischievous and amorous. More inclined to intrigue and playing wing-man than being the one to land the killing blow or use the legendary magical artifact with the world-destroying potential.  

I have always been drawn to the bard as a concept and an archetype, to the point where I have to be very intentional about _not_ making it my class whenever it is an option in any fantasy RPG. Although I think I'm so self-aware of this preference to that I actually almost never let myself select the bard, even though it is always the first thing that comes to my mind (this seems to be a running theme with me and things I like/want). I believe my inclination for the bard is tied to two things: the freedom to travel and go on adventures, and the romantic ideal of the storyteller. They exist to experience things, and then to recount those experiences in delightful and entertaining ways. Life is an experience and a search for knowledge. If I had the option to live an alternate life in a time and situation of my own choosing, something I would very seriously consider would be the life of a charismatic travelling storyteller and musician in the 12th or 13th century.Â   

However, one thing has always puzzled me a little bit about bards: their name. _Bard_. It's probably the word I, and most people, use most to describe a traveling performer from a Mediaevel or quasi-Mediaeval setting. But sometimes I slip up and use the word _minstrel_ instead. There's also _troubadour_ and _jongleur_, and _skald._ I have used each of these words at least once, if not in my speech, then certainly in my thoughts. They're all performers from the Mediaevelish era, specialising chiefly in story, poem, and song. So they all mean roughly the same thing and can be used interchangeably. _Right_?   

I suppose.Â 

I think.Â 

But I also feel that in grouping them all so carelessly together there is much richness that is being missed out on. And probably also more names that I don't know of.  

### A bard by any other name  

The most obvious difference between all of these lies in their language of origin: _minstrel_ is from Latin, _skald_ from Old Norse, _troubadour_ comes from lenga d'Oc (also known asÂ  ProvenÃ§al or the Occitan language), _jongeleur_ is from langue d'Oil (which went on to become French as we know it today), and _bard_ is from British Gaelic.

There are also Old English _scops_, German *minnesingers*, and gleemen.  

Looking only at the languages which these words originate from we get quite a wide geographic range.  

Â The name and location of origin can tell us a bit about their essence, but there's also a lot that a name and location alone _cannot_ tell us. Is the difference between the bard, the jongleur, the minstrel, the troubadour and the skald then just a matter of place and language or is there something more substantial? I think the answer lies right in that phrase. Language and culture have strong ties, and I think it is worth looking a little deeper and investigate whether the distinct cultures that these entities sprung from shaped them in unique ways. We know who and we know where, now it's time for what, why, and how.
