On Thursday of this week we adopted a beautiful bowl-back mandolin. It was, perhaps, a little impulsive. To meet it on Wednesday and add it to the family on Thursday. It's missing a part of its bridge, but we're going to take it to a luthier to get that replaced in the next week or two. I am extremely excited!

*Isn't he pretty? I'm still thinking up a name. Definitely something Italian.*

I have been thinking, desiring, for a long time now to truly try my hand at learning music. I have always (rather inexplicably, I'd say) been intrigued by bards and lutes and harps and the wandering musicians of bygone eras. But while my father always dabbled in guitar privately and appreciated opera, classic music and the pop music of his youth, my family was never otherwise particularly musical. 

I did music up to grade 9 as is the standard in my country, but it was certainly not my favourite subject. In fact in grade 8 and 9 I remember disdaining it quite vehemently. Our teacher was relentlessly passionate about her subject and made sure we always had enough homework to do her passion proud. But visual art was my calling, so why did I need to waste so much time memorising crotchets and quavers? Especially when I was already struggling to squeeze in extra maths to wrap my head around algebra and trigonometry too. 

Ironically enough, at that same time I actually had a keyboard in my bedroom and dabbled--probably only about once a week--at its keys using a little book filled with basic songs. In hindsight, I think the main reason I didn't end up sticking with it was three-fold: it took up a lot of space in my tiny room. The only place it could fit was on my desk, which I also used for drawing and homework. So it was either on the desk for days at a time, or off the desk for days at a time. It needed to be plugged in too, and I was short on plug space, so it spent more time off my desk, unplugged, than on the desk, plugged in, and easily accessible to play. Lastly, though I had friends who knew music--piano specifically--I never took much initiative to 

But back to the Mandolin.

I have always thought this sort of instrument is just a lute. Rather embarrassing now that I know better. A descendant of the lute, yes, but not a lute in its own right. Much younger than the lute for starters. But it is a beautiful looking instrument that, to me, still evokes something Mediaeval. The metallic twinge of its strings feels warm and traditional and old. It is pleasant to hold, with a satisfying weight and a wonderful feel to it, and even if it were only to be mounted on the wall I think its aesthetic value alone makes it a worthwhile addition to the household. Keeping it only as a decorative piece would, of course, be a sad fate for an instrument that was made to be played. But the art is all still a mystery to me. To be able to play an instrument and sing at the same time is to me a sort of ancient and most magnificent magic. A magic I now need to begin to make sense of. I have already begun to seek some lessons through YouTube, which many kind souls have freely shared. Tabs I can already make some sense of, and memories of that music theory that was forced into me during high school has come rushing back. Now the question is whether or not my fingers will be able to build up the same steam as my mind, and whether I can keep practicing consistently. 

At this stage I have a few simple goals for myself:
- Practice for at least 30 minutes everyday
- Learn to play Amazing Grace - a tune I know very well and have sung many times
- Start reading up about music theory

I have set myself a minimum count of 20 hours. If I can do all of the above for a total of 20 hours, then I have at least given it a good go and set some foundations for myself. Beyond that my goal is to be able to play Amazing Grace well enough that I can sing it while I play, fairly uninterrupted from beginning to end. Once I have gotten a grip on that song I have a handful of others I hope to learn.

I have two little dreams with this mandolin in mind: sitting on the arm-chair in the living room after workhours and strumming out songs while singing them, and, one day, taking it along with me to a mediaeval fair and giving Miri it is while summer ilast, Greensleeves and Ja Nus Hons Pris all a go. Not to perform in front of an audience (please no) so much as to walk about and feel like a wandering bard minding my own business and playing for my own pleasure.

## Songs I hope to learn to play on the mandolin
- Amazing Grace
- The Bard's Song by Blind Guardian
- The Epic of Gilgamesh (as put to music by Peter Pringle)
- France 1184 (from Kingdom of Heaven) (https://chordify.net/chords/harry-gregson-williams-songs/france-1184-chords?)
- Greensleeves
- Ja Nus Hons Pris
- Leliana's Song
- Miri it is while summer ilast
- O come, O come Emmanuel
- Rise (from Dragon Age Inquisition)
- Scarborough Fair
- Under a Violet Moon by Blackmore's Night

And once (if ever) I manage to master, or at least become sufficiently competent, in the mandolin I hope I can, perhaps, expand my repertoire to encompass the darling lute and the magnificent hurdy gurdy as well.
